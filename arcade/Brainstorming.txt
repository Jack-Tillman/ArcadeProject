Main Style Sheet and Ideas textfile 

Key to read: due to simplicity of the Notepad app, I will 
maintain readable format through arduous adherance to this
arbitrary code of honor, so to speak. The general format 
will be to write 5 separate blocks of text to describe the 
Goal of that webpage, what I will do in HTML, CSS, and JS, 
and anything else that may need to be listed. 
Format wise, I will try to make a new text block for all 5 
sites. Indents with a hyphen indicate the line below is a 
subfeature of the line above, or necessary detail. 

Overarching Goal: Create 5 websites that are all accessed through 
the 'home' page. I will start with the home page. 

for ease of access, here's rgb for colors i might use
Eggplant (subdued purple) : 83, 59, 77
new green : 43, 153, 80
Night black: 8, 12, 9
Snow white: 255, 250, 251
Amethyst (strong purple): 155, 93, 229

Royal purple: 37, 28, 161
 white: 214, 238, 240



			    Home Page 




Goal: create a website that enables user to select 4 separate
games to play. 

HTML: -NOTE that the structure of the main page will be used for the others

- Header will feature really fast made 'JACK'S ARCADE' logo on left side, and 
home button, and an obvious link to the other games on the right
- Body will feature a plain, appealing BG color, a large, visible container
for all of the games, a picture of the game and description as well as 
a 'PLAY NOW' button that will redirect to other pages 
- EXTRA: footer will exist, but feature just a clickable 
picture link to my GitHub repo for the project 

CSS: 
- The color scheme will be very on-the-nose arcade, but not obnoxious.
in human speak, the main colors will be black, white, purple, and maybe blue. 
- EXTRA: add in the arcade carpet design as a background, and likely reduce the
opacity a little bit so it isn't garish or difficult to read text 
- First pass: Use black and white as the main colors, and the others as 
splashes of color 
- font: stick with basic sans-serif at first, then if extra time, try
to find an appropriately whacky font that could be used perhaps 
- header will be sticky if needed 

JS: event handlers for clicking on PLAY NOW button (actually, could
probably just get away with wrapping the button in an <a> tag or vice versa

				


				GAME 1 - TicTacToe 
similar project done already: https://codepen.io/johntillman123/pen/YzJqXqo

Goals for singleplayer: 
- See the name 'Computer' displayed as my opponent
- have the Computer player make moves as if it were a human player 
with the correct mark in an empty space

Goals for two player game:
- Allow players to enter their names and have them displayed 
- Have function to choose game order 
- Take turns placing their marks in empty spaces
- not be able to place their marks in an occupied space 
- be told when a move causes a player to win or draw
- start the game over without having to reset the browser 

HTML: 
-Header same as mainpage 
- 



Misc Notes:
Can use a similar validator that was used for Sudoku project for both tic tac Toe
and connect 4 / 
Somewhere in the global scope, keep a variable that represents what you
want the current 'state' of the game to look like 
let gameArray = ['X', null, 'O', null, null, null, null, null, null]
every time click on board, (check pic for more)

05/13/23 Update:
Will make some revisions before second submission: 
Focus on the top and if time, do the bottom
1) Display player names on screen at all times 
- can create a section at the top of the main section that displays player names 
2) Computer player 
- rough version, just utilize setInterval 
- more complex version, look into minimax algorithm or whatever it is called 
3) replace the prompts for user names with a box that shows up before game starts 
- Game Name 
- Input form, placeholder="What is your name?" 
- Button with id of submit 
4) clean up the index main page 
5) add cute animations around buttons when clicked or maybe just general
