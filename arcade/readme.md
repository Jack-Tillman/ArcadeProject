Hello! This is my submission for the Fullstack Academy Arcade project. The goal is to create a website
that features 4 separate games that a user can play. However, I only was able to complete the Tic Tac Toe game. Sadly,
I wasn't able to add computer play functionality, so when you are prompted whether to play against a computer or not, 
just click 'cancel.'
